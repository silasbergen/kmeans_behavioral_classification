# kmeans_behavioral_classification

This repository contains example R code and data to reproduce the analysis described by Bergen, Huso, Duerr, Braham, Katzner, and Miller ***Classifying behavior from short-interval bio-logging data: an example with GPS tracking of birds.***  

Data: *eagle_subset.csv*, a subset representing two of the bald eagles used in the analysis.  Other fields:
* `segment_id`: ID of segment of contiguous points <= 11s apart
* `X`, `Y`: coordinates of fix; `X` and `Y` are in UTM-15 meters.

For definitions of the remaining variables, see the manuscript.
